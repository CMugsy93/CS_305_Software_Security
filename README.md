# CS_305_Software_Security

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They wanted to update their operations and improve their security to ensure their customers that their financial and other crucially important personal information is properly protected. 

Some of the issues I came across were outdated dependencies and unprotected variables that were not initialized. It is extremely important to code securely because society is almost entirely on the internet. This makes having peoples information secure extremely important. If someone entrusts your company with their information, money, or other valuable assets and you fail to protect them, it can mean huge repurcusions for your company. 

I find that using the maven dependency check is both amazing and difficult for me to understand. It is amazing because it can find all kinds of issues your code has from a security standpoint. On the other hand, at least at the level I am currently at, I find it hard to differentiate between actual issues and false positives. With more time learning it however, I can see how powerful a tool it can be.

Following the vulnerability assessment flow diagram, I found that if you work your way through it, you will be able to increase the security of the program tenfold. I think that using that alongside the maven dependency check and following NIST guidelines, you can get a secure program with minimal security risks.

Once the dependency check and manual assessment of the code base was done, I would use static and dynamic testing to ensure that the program was still working as intended and none of the dependencies were exploited. I would do this for each refactoring I do on the code base.

As I have stated above, the maen dependency check tool is incredible and look forward to using it in the future. Alongside that, this course has made me look at my code a bit differently as I am now aware that even the most seemingly minor mistakes can have huge consequences, so it is important to have security on the mind from the very beginning.

While I do feel I still have a ton to learn when it comes to securely coding, I think that this course has taught me that there are some really powerful tools that can be used that not only speed up the development process but also are absolutely vital in security. I think that having security in mind from the beginning of a project is both crucial and wise. My ability to find inadequacies in the security of a program and to also differentiate between actual issues and false postives can only be beneficial to an employer.
